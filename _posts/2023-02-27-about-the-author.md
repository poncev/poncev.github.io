My name is Felipe Ponce-Vanegas. I am a postdoc fellow at
the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM).

The research topic of my <a href="https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/63368" target="_blank"> PhD thesis </a> was the problem of
restriction of the Fourier Transform and its applications.
Currently, I work on signal processing, and
I am in close contact with researchers and engineers at the
Aeronautics Advanced Manufacturing Center (CFAA) in Zamudio.

Check out this <a href="https://gitlab.bcamath.org/fponce/git-for-mathematicians/-/tree/main" target="_blank"> git course </a> I gave at BCAM.
