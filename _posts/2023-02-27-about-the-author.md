My name is Felipe Ponce-Vanegas, and I am a postdoc fellow at
the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics (BCAM) in
the Basque Country, Spain.

The research topic of my <a href="https://repositorio.unal.edu.co/handle/unal/63368" target="_blank"> PhD thesis </a> was the problem of
restriction of the Fourier Transform and its applications.
Currently, I work on signal processing, and
I am in close contact with researchers and engineers at the
Aeronautics Advanced Manufacturing Center (CFAA) in Zamudio.
